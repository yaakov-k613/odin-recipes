    <h1>Funky Cholent Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../img/img-funky-cholent.jpg" alt="A delicious bowl of cholent" width="300">
    <p style="width: 300px; text-align: justify;">Cholent is a Shabbos lunch standard in many Jewish homes. Every family
        has their signature cholent. This recipe
        took me twelve years to perfect, and includes secrets I learned from ten different families. Cholent is meant to
        be experimented with. Some interesting additions you may want to try are soy sauce, honey, paprika, or left-over
        beef gravy.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>1 pound beef stew meat, cubed</li>
        <li>5 large potatoes, cubed</li>
        <li>1 sweet potato, cubed</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) can baked beans</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ketchup</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon barbecue sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon prepared yellow mustard</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dry onion soup mix</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons seasoned salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon steak seasoning</li>
        <li>Â½ cup pearl barley</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol style="width: 300px; text-align: justify;">
        <li>Heat the oil in a large soup pot over medium heat; cook and stir the onion and garlic until the onion is
            translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the beef stew meat, and quickly brown the pieces on all sides. Stir in the
            potatoes, sweet potato, baked beans, ketchup, barbecue sauce, mustard, onion soup mix, seasoned salt, and
            steak seasoning, and pour in enough water to cover. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and
            cook on low heat until the beef is tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Stir in the pearl barley, and transfer the stew to a slow cooker set on Low until the barley is tender,
            about 12 hours.</li>
    </ol>

    <h1 id="microwave-popcorn">Microwave Popcorn Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../img/img_microwavepopcorn.jpg" alt="A bowl of popcorn" width="300">
    <p style="width: 300px; text-align: justify;">Believe it or not, you can make your own delicious, low-fat microwave
        popcorn using standard popping corn and a
        brown paper lunch bag. It works perfectly.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul style="width: 300px;">
        <li>&frac12 cup unpopped popcorn</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>&frac12 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol start="1" style="width: 265px; text-align: justify;">
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Mix together unpopped popcorn and oil in a cup or small bowl.</li>
        <li>Pour the coated corn into a brown paper lunch sack, and sprinkle in the salt. Fold the top of the bag over
            twice to seal in the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Cook in the microwave at full power for 2&frac12 to 3 minutes, or until you hear pauses of about 2 seconds
            between pops. Carefully open the bag to avoid steam, and pour into a serving bowl.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Note</h3>
    <p style="width: 300px; text-align: justify;">A few kernels will remain unpopped. Longer cooking may pop the rest, but will burn some of the already-popped
        kernels, so it is not recommended.</p>
